      "message": "The comment and naming is supposed to point to what is happening.  Ever done interesting things with the C-preprocessor?\n\nThis file is built via `cc -DHWADDRS_MAC_PREFIX\u003d$(HWADDRS_MAC_PREFIX)` if $(HWADDRS_MAC_PREFIX) is defined.  An example definition would be the line \"HWADDRS_MAC_PREFIX :\u003d \\\\xDE\\\\xAD\\\\xBE\" in BoardConfig.mk.\n\nDifficulty is where this is used it needs to be a string.  Given the above definition in BoardConfig.mk would result in the equivalent of the line `#define HWADDRS_MAC_PREFIX_STR \"\\xDE\\xAD\\xBE\"`.  This generates the needed effect.\n\nIf you feel there is a need for more commentary, say so.  This is very much preprocessor black magic.",

If you\u0027re not used to bit manipulation I\u0027m unsure I can cover enough for a good explanation here.\n\nThis is identifying which low-order bits are always zero and thus are indications of garbled input/attack if set.  Guess this really would be better as (~HWADDRS_OFFSET_MIN\u0026~HWADDRS_OFFSET_MAX) (instead flagging all bits which are zero for all valid inputs).",
